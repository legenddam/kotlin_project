account.info.msg=Here you can setup trading accounts for national currencies & altcoins, select arbitrators and backup your wallet & account data.\n\n\
An empty Bitcoin wallet was created the first time you started Bitsquare.\n\
For Bitcoin trading, you are not required to set up any additional accounts. We recommend that you write down your Bitcoin wallet seed words (see button on the left) and consider adding a password before funding. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are managed in the \"Funds\" section.\n\n\
Privacy & Security:\n\
Bitsquare is a decentralized exchange – meaning all of your data is kept on your computer, there are no servers and we have no access to your personal info, your funds or even your IP address. Data such as bank account numbers, altcoin & Bitcoin addresses, etc are only shared with your trading partner to fulfill trades you initiate (in case of a dispute the arbitrator will see the same data like your trading peer).

account.arbitratorRegistration.registerFailed=Could not register arbitrator.{0}

account.altcoin.yourAltcoinAccounts=Your altcoin accounts:
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.msg=Please be sure that you follow the requirements for the usage of {0} wallets as \
described on the {1} web page.\nUsing wallets from centralized exchanges where you don't have your keys under \
your control or using a not compatible wallet software can lead to loss of the traded funds!\nThe arbitrator is \
not a {2} specialist and cannot help in such cases.
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.confirm=I understand and confirm that I know which wallet I need to use.
account.altcoin.popup.xmr.msg=If you want to trade XMR on Bitsquare please be sure you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending XMR you need to use either the official Monero GUI wallet or the Monero simple wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (default in new versions).\n\
Please be sure that you can access the tx key (use the get_tx_key command in simplewallet) as that \
would be required in case of a dispute to enable the arbitrator to verify the XMR transfer with \
the XMR checktx tool (http://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html).\n\
At normal block explorers the transfer is not verifiable.\n\n\
You need to provide the arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
If you cannot provide the above data or if you used an incompatible wallet it would result in losing the \
dispute case. The XMR sender is responsible to be able to verify the XMR transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\
There is no payment ID required, just the normal public address.\n\n\
If you are not sure about that process visit the Monero forum (https://forum.getmonero.org) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.transparentTx.msg=When using {0} you can only use the transparent addresses (starting with t) not \
the z-addresses (private), because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with z-addresses.

account.seed.info=Please write down both wallet seed words and the date! \
You can recover your wallet any time with those seed words and the date.\n\
The seed words are used for both the BTC and the BSQ wallet.\n\n\
You should write down the seed words on a sheet of paper and not save them on your computer.\n\n\
Please note that the seed words are not a replacement for a backup.\n\
You need to backup the whole application directory at the \"Account/Backup\" screen to recover the valid application state and data.
account.seed.warn.noPw.msg=You have not setup a wallet password which would protect the display of the seed words.\n\n\
Do you want to display the seed words?
