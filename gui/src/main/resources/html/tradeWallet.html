<h1>Information</h1>
Bitsquare does not use a global wallet.<br/>
For every trade a dedicated wallet will be created. Funding of the wallet will be done just in time when it is needed.
For instance when you create an offer or
when you take an offer. Withdrawing from your funds can be done after a trade has been completed.<br/>
That separation of addresses helps to protect users privacy and not leaking information of previous trades to new
traders.<br/>
Please read more background information to that topic at the Bitsquare <a href="https://bitsquare.io/faq/#tradeWallet"
