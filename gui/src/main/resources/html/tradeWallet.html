<h1>Information</h1>
Bitsquare does not use a single application wallet, but dedicated wallets for every trade.<br/>
Funding of the wallet will be done when needed, for instance when you create or take an offer.
Withdrawing funds can be done after a trade is completed.<br/>
Dedicated wallets help protect user privacy and prevent leaking information of previous trades to other
traders.<br/>
For more background information please see the Bitsquare <a href="https://bitsquare.io/faq/#tradeWallet"
