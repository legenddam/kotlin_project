Pull requests

We are aiming to follow the principles and establish the workflow used at the Bitcoin Core project. 
Please check out the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
The full workflow is not used yet as there are not enough dedicated developers, but as soon that situation changes we will move 
to a model with ACK/NACK, code reviews and maintainer roles.
