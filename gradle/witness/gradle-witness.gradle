// To update the `dependencyVerification` block below (we don't add local bisq modules and org.openjfx libraries as
// those cause problems):
//
// 1. Remove the block entirely
// 2. Replace the block with the following command:
//
//    ./gradlew -q calculateChecksums | grep -v 'bisq:\|org.openjfx:' >> gradle/witness/gradle-witness.gradle
//
// 3. Run `git diff` to verify that expected hashes have changed
// 4. Commit the changes
//
// See https://github.com/signalapp/gradle-witness#using-witness for further details.
