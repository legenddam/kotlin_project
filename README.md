Bitsquare is a cross-platform application that allows users to trade fiat money (dollars, euros, etc) for bitcoin without relying on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp or (the former) Mt. Gox.

By running Bitsquare on their local machine, users form a peer-to-peer network. Offers to buy and sell bitcoin are broadcast to that network, and through the process of offering and accepting these trades, a market is established.

There are no central points of control or failure in the Bitsquare network. There are no trusted third parties. When two parties agree to trade fiat money for bitcoin, the bitcoin to be bought or sold is held in escrow using the multisignature transaction capabilities built in to the bitcoin protocol.

Because the fiat money portion of any trade must be transferred via traditional means such as wire transfers, Bitsquare includes first-class support for human arbitration to handle any errors or disputes.

You can read about all of this and more in the [overview](), [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3EiWZdaM89-P6MVhS53unXv2-pDpSFsN3W4kCGXKgY/edit#), [arbitration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJCRFdtM2Jn2Oiv49qRXwBDG8HZD0Hiedy8tNjErHps/edit) and [risk analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sHwU7K7C8Nl-fS4Z6X88L-NVJ_WBiKnsSpYpYfyqUXA/edit) documents.
