Bitsquare is a P2P Fiat-BTC Exchange, extensible to a generic P2P trading platform (include commodities and
cryptocurrencies)

This is just a first very basic GUI prototype with mock data.
There is only the trade process for Sell BTC and the role of the offer taker modelled yet.

Done:
* Screen for orderbook with filtering mock offers by amount, price and order type (buy, sell), other filters not impl. yet
* Screen for creating an offer (needs update)
* Screen for offer taking and payment process
* Simple storage for some filter attributes


Next steps:
* Other trade variants (Buy BTC taker, Sell BTC offerer, Sell BTC offerer)
* Arbitrator integration
* bitcoinj integration
* messaging system
* ...


The project use Java 8 and Maven.
